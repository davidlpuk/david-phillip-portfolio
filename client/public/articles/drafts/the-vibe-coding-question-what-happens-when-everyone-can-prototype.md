# The Vibe Coding Question: What Happens When Everyone Can Prototype?

### 
      Why non-designers building interfaces isn't a threat—it's a shift in where design value gets created

      A product manager I spoke with recently mentioned, almost in passing, that he'd built a working prototype over the weekend. Not wireframes. Not a Figma mockup. A functional application with real interactions, connected to a database, deployed and shareable.
    

  

            
        
    

      He's not technical. Six months ago, he couldn't have done this.
    

  

            
        
    

      This is becoming common. Founders are building MVPs without engineering support. Product managers are exploring ideas in code before writing specifications. Researchers are creating functional stimuli for testing. People across organisations are making things that, until recently, required either design or engineering skills to produce.
    

  

            
        
    

      The tools enabling this—Cursor, Replit, Claude, various AI coding assistants—have lowered the barrier to building software dramatically. "Vibe coding," as some have started calling it, describes this phenomenon: producing working applications through natural language prompts and iterative conversation with AI, without traditional programming knowledge.
    

  

            
        
    

      For designers, this raises an uncomfortable question: if prototyping was part of our value, and now anyone can prototype, what does that mean for us?
    

  

            
        
    

### 
      The Anxiety Is Understandable
    

  

            
        
    

      Let's be direct about what's unsettling here.
    

  

            
        
    

      For years, designers occupied a specific position in the product development process. We were the ones who could translate ideas into tangible form. Even when we weren't writing production code, we could create high-fidelity representations that let teams see and react to concepts before committing engineering resources.
    

  

            
        
    

      This ability to make ideas concrete—faster and cheaper than building them properly—was genuinely valuable. It created a bottleneck that designers controlled.
    

  

            
        
    

      Now that bottleneck is loosening. A product manager with a clear idea and a few hours can produce something that looks and functions like a real product. They don't need to wait for design. They don't need to write a brief. They don't need us.
    

  

            
        
    

      If your sense of professional value was tied to being the person who could make things tangible, this shift is legitimately threatening. That's not irrational. It's an accurate reading of what's changing.
    

  

            
        
    

### 
      What's Actually Happening
    

  

            
        
    

      Before addressing implications, it's worth being precise about what these tools do and don't enable.
    

  

            
        
    

      **They dramatically lower the floor for functional prototypes.** Someone with no technical background can now produce a working application. The baseline of what's achievable without specialised skills has risen significantly.
    

  

            
        
    

      **They don't automatically produce good work.** The prototypes emerging from vibe coding are often functional but crude. They work, but they don't feel considered. They solve the immediate problem but miss edge cases, accessibility requirements, and the refinements that make interfaces feel coherent.
    

  

            
        
    

      **They compress the path from idea to artefact.** What previously required multiple handoffs—idea to spec to wireframe to mockup to prototype—can now happen in a single session. This speed changes how teams can explore and validate concepts.
    

  

            
        
    

      **They shift the constraint from "can we build it?" to "should we build it?"** When production is cheap, the limiting factor becomes judgment about what's worth producing. The bottleneck moves upstream.
    

  

            
        
    

      This last point matters most. The tools change where value accumulates, not whether value exists.
    

  

            
        
    

### 
      Where Design Value Actually Lives
    

  

            
        
    

      If prototyping becomes democratised, the value of being able to prototype decreases. That's straightforward. But prototyping was never the entirety of design's contribution—it was just the most visible part.
    

  

            
        
    

      Consider what remains scarce:
    

  

            
        
    

      **Understanding users deeply.** Knowing how people actually think about a problem space, what mental models they bring, where they struggle, what they value. This comes from sustained exposure and attention. AI tools don't provide it. A PM building a weekend prototype doesn't suddenly acquire it.
    

  

            
        
    

      **Judgment about what to build.** Generating options is cheap. Knowing which option serves users, fits the broader product, aligns with business constraints, and warrants investment—that's expensive. It requires context that takes time to develop.
    

  

            
        
    

      **Coherence across a product.** Individual screens or features can be vibe-coded in isolation. Making them feel like parts of a unified whole—consistent patterns, considered information architecture, coherent visual language—requires a perspective that spans the entire experience.
    

  

            
        
    

      **Craft at the level of detail.** The micro-decisions that make interfaces feel responsive, clear, and considered. Spacing, timing, copy, hierarchy, error handling, empty states. These are precisely the elements that AI-generated prototypes tend to lack.
    

  

            
        
    

      **Ability to articulate and defend choices.** Explaining why one approach serves users better than another, in terms that stakeholders can evaluate. Building shared understanding. Navigating trade-offs explicitly rather than arbitrarily.
    

  

            
        
    

      None of these become less important when more people can produce functional prototypes. If anything, they become more important—because there are now more prototypes that need to be evaluated, refined, or rejected.
    

  

            
        
    

### 
      The Collaboration Shift
    

  

            
        
    

      The more interesting implication isn't about threat—it's about how collaboration changes.
    

  

            
        
    

      When a PM can build a working prototype, the conversation shifts. Instead of reviewing static mockups and imagining how something might work, you're reacting to something that already functions. The feedback becomes more concrete. The gaps become more visible.
    

  

            
        
    

      This can be better for design, not worse.
    

  

            
        
    

      Consider the alternative: a PM has an idea, writes a document describing it, hands it to a designer who interprets that document, produces mockups, presents them back, receives feedback that reveals the original idea was misunderstood, iterates, and eventually reaches something the PM recognises. This process has friction at every handoff.
    

  

            
        
    

      Now consider: a PM has an idea, builds a rough version over a weekend, shows it to you. You can immediately see what they're thinking. You can identify what's working and what isn't. You can take it and improve it, or you can explain why a different approach would serve users better. The conversation starts further along.
    

  

            
        
    

      This requires a shift in posture. Designers who see their role as controlling the creation of artefacts will experience this as encroachment. Designers who see their role as improving outcomes—regardless of who produced the initial artefact—will find new leverage.
    

  

            
        
    

### 
      Practical Implications
    

  

            
        
    

      If this shift is real and ongoing, what should designers actually do about it?
    

  

            
        
    

      **Get comfortable with artefacts you didn't create.** Develop the ability to evaluate, critique, and improve prototypes built by others. This is a different skill from creating from scratch, and it's increasingly valuable.
    

  

            
        
    

      **Focus on the layers that vibe coding doesn't reach.** User understanding, product coherence, interaction details, accessibility, edge cases. These are where AI-generated prototypes consistently fall short. They're also where design expertise has the most leverage.
    

  

            
        
    

      **Invest in your own prototyping capability.** The tools that enable PMs to build prototypes are even more powerful in the hands of someone with design judgment. Being able to produce high-quality functional work quickly—not just technically functional, but well-considered—is a genuine advantage.
    

  

            
        
    

      **Move upstream.** If execution becomes democratised, influence shifts toward the decisions that determine what gets executed. Understanding strategy, business context, and user needs positions you to shape those decisions rather than just implementing them.
    

  

            
        
    

      **Articulate value in terms of outcomes.** "I made the mockups" becomes less compelling when others can make mockups too. "I identified why the original approach would confuse users and proposed an alternative that tested significantly better" remains compelling regardless of who can prototype.
    

  

            
        
    

### 
      The Real Question
    

  

            
        
    

      The anxiety about vibe coding often frames the situation as: will designers still be needed?
    

  

            
        
    

      That's the wrong question. The right question is: what will designers be needed for?
    

  

            
        
    

      The answer isn't "making things tangible"—that's becoming a commodity. The answer is judgment, coherence, craft, and user understanding. The things that turn functional prototypes into products people actually want to use.
    

  

            
        
    

      These were always the core of the discipline. Execution ability was a necessary prerequisite that made them applicable. Now that prerequisite is loosening, and what remains is the actual substance of design expertise.
    

  

            
        
    

      That's not a diminishment. It's a clarification.

      **How are you experiencing this shift in your own work?** I'm curious whether others are seeing non-designers prototype more often, and how it's changing collaboration.
