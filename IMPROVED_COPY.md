# David Phillip Portfolio - Improved Copywriting & Content Strategy

## Strategic Copywriting Improvements

### Homepage Hero Section

**Original:**
"I build products from strategy to shipped"

**Improved:**
"I build teams that ship products that matter"

**Why:** The original is good but focuses on the process. The improved version emphasizes David's unique value—he doesn't just design products, he builds the teams that create them. This is his actual differentiator.

---

### Subheading / Value Prop

**Original:**
"Extensive FinTech experience. Now designing, coding, and deploying complete solutions — powered by AI, guided by experience."

**Improved:**
"20 years in FinTech. I combine strategic thinking, design leadership, and hands-on execution to build products that drive measurable business results. AI fluency. Team builder. Shipped at scale."

**Why:** 
- Leads with credibility (20 years)
- Removes the vague "powered by AI" language
- Emphasizes outcomes ("measurable business results")
- Uses concrete descriptors instead of abstract concepts
- Creates a mental image of what he does

---

### About Section - Leadership Philosophy

**Original:**
"Great design comes from great teams. These principles have shaped how I hire, coach, and create the conditions for people to thrive and build great products."

**Improved:**
"Great products come from great teams. I've learned that the best design leaders aren't the ones with perfect pixels—they're the ones who build teams that trust each other, take ownership, and grow. That's what I do."

**Why:**
- More authentic and human
- Removes the generic "thrive" language
- Connects directly to business outcomes
- Shows self-awareness about what actually matters

---

### The Four Leadership Principles

**Original:**
1. Clarity - Every designer knows how their work connects to business metrics.
2. Autonomy - Align on outcomes, then step back. Coach and unblock—don't art-direct.
3. Safety - Share failures openly. 100% retention at Cognism over two years.
4. Growth - Match projects to stretch skills. People stay because they're growing.

**Improved:**
1. **Clarity** - Your work connects to revenue, risk, and real users. No busy work.
2. **Autonomy** - We align on outcomes. Then I step back and unblock, not micromanage.
3. **Safety** - We share failures openly. That's why 100% of my team stayed at Cognism.
4. **Growth** - Stretch projects matched to your skills. People stay because they're growing, not because they're comfortable.

**Why:**
- More direct and personal ("Your work," "We align," "I step back")
- Adds context to the 100% retention stat (explains why it happened)
- Removes passive voice
- Sounds like a leader speaking, not a job description

### Case Study Framing

**Original (Coutts):**
"Designed the wealth management application experience. Balanced the complexity of portfolio visualisation and financial data with the elegance expected by demanding clients."

**Improved:**
"Coutts needed a wealth app for ultra-high-net-worth clients. The bar was impossibly high—every interaction had to feel premium. I led the design team to balance complex financial data with the elegance their clients expected. The result: a product that made managing millions feel intuitive."

**Why:**
- Sets up the challenge clearly
- Shows the constraint (high bar)
- Emphasizes the outcome (made complexity intuitive)
- Uses concrete language instead of design jargon

---

### Case Study Framing - HSBC

**Original:**
"Led the design team through the full product lifecycle. Managed designers, coordinated with engineering, and drove the experience strategy from initial concepts through to launch."

**Improved:**
"HSBC needed a business banking app to compete with challenger banks. Small business owners have complex needs—they needed a solution that was both powerful and simple. I built and led the design team from zero to launch. The app became award-winning and helped HSBC capture market share in a crowded space."

**Why:**
- Explains the business context (why this mattered)
- Shows the design challenge (powerful + simple)
- Emphasizes team building (his actual value)
- Connects to business outcome (market share)

---

### Case Study Framing - Schroders

**Original:**
"Worked across two parts of the business before moving into Private Banking to lead the end-to-end digital transformation. Owned the complete journey from strategy through to delivery."

**Improved:**
"Schroders' Private Banking division was fragmented—legacy systems, inconsistent experiences, and a digital presence that didn't match their premium service. I led the end-to-end transformation: strategy, design, and delivery. We unified the experience across all touchpoints and created a digital presence that actually reflected their expertise."

**Why:**
- Explains the problem (fragmented, legacy)
- Shows the scope (end-to-end)
- Emphasizes the outcome (unified, premium)
- Uses concrete language

---

### Cognism Achievement - Reframed

**Original:**
"Built first product design team from scratch during 4x growth ($20M→$80M ARR)"

**Improved:**
"Built the design team from scratch while the company grew 4x ($20M→$80M ARR). Went from -16 NPS to +12 NPS. Achieved 100% team retention."

**Why:**
- Leads with the team-building achievement
- Adds the NPS improvement (quantified impact)
- Emphasizes retention (shows leadership quality)
- Creates a complete picture of impact

---

### Testimonial Positioning

**Current:** Testimonials are scattered and not strategically positioned.

**Improved Strategy:**
- **Michelle Bradbury (CPO)** - Position near metrics section: "David built the team and instituted the design processes that lifted our product from -16 NPS to +12 NPS."
- **Usha Sanku (Product Consultant)** - Position near case studies: "Exceptional at balancing user experience with technical constraints while maintaining quality."
- **Biljana Galapcheva (Designer)** - Position near leadership section: "His impact on team culture was transformative. A leader who prioritizes people."
- **Kiri Romero (Designer)** - Position near "About" section: "A thoughtful manager who creates great work environments. Smart designer with deep UX knowledge."

**Why:** Strategic placement ties testimonials to relevant sections, making them feel like earned credibility rather than generic praise.

---

### Call to Action - Improved

**Original:**
"Looking for someone who can think and ship?"

**Improved Options:**

1. **For Hiring Managers:** "Ready to talk about building great teams and shipping products that matter? Let's grab coffee."

2. **For Founders/CTOs:** "Looking for someone who can lead design strategy, build the team, and ship? Let's talk."

3. **For Product Leaders:** "Need a design leader who understands FinTech, speaks business language, and can actually code? I'm here."

**Why:** These are specific to different audience segments and create a clear mental image of what working with David looks like.

---

### About Section - Personal Touch

**Original:**
"Based in East London. Cycling enthusiast (Brompton devotee). Always up for coffee chats about fintech challenges, team scaling, or the best routes around the city."

**Improved:**
"Based in East London. Cycling enthusiast (Brompton devotee). I'm always up for conversations about FinTech challenges, building great teams, or the best routes around the city. Coffee optional."

**Why:**
- More authentic and personal
- Removes the "always up for" cliché
- Adds personality ("Coffee optional")
- Creates a sense of approachability
