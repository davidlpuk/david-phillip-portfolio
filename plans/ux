## Implementation Considerations

Each additional phase would require:
1. New accordion section in `CaseStudy.tsx`
2. Updated const data in `shared/const.ts`
3. Supporting imagery/assets (optional)
4. Matching styling to existing sections

The existing accordion component pattern can be reused for consistency.
