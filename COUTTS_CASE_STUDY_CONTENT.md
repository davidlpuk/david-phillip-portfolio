## Context, Strategy and Vision

### Business Context
Coutts serves Britain's wealthiest families, including the Royal Family. But their digital experience was stuck in the 2000s.

Clients managing eight-figure portfolios used clunky legacy portals while competitors won younger prospects with modern apps. 40% of prospects under 50 cited outdated digital tools as their reason for choosing competitors.

## Key Learnings
1. **Transformation requires political acumen, not just design craft**: Navigating stakeholder complexity and proving value in the language of revenue and risk—these create lasting impact in established organisations.

2. **Make gatekeepers co-creators**: Embed regulatory and compliance functions in the creative process. Their constraints become design inputs, and they become advocates for your work.

3. **Invest in capability, not just deliverables**: Apps can be rebuilt, but organisational capability compounds. Build teams, processes, and culture that sustain transformation after you're gone.

## Summary
I scaled the team, shipped a top-rated app, and helped unlock millions in new assets. The project demonstrates ability to lead design in complex, regulated environments with high-stakes stakeholder management.


## Key Actions and Deliverables

### 1. Scaled Design Team and Built Organisational Capability

Grew team from 5 to 15 specialists (UX, UI, Research, Operations) with 100% retention.

Established Coutts' **first dedicated UX Research practice**, shifting the organisation from opinion-driven to evidence-based decisions through quarterly research cycles that informed product roadmap.

### 2. Spearheaded Group-Wide Figma Migration

Led the migration from Sketch to Figma across the entire NatWest Group—4 brands, 280+ designers. Built ROI model showing estimated £200k+ annual savings in rework and tool convergence.

Established cross-brand design system governance, creating a single source of truth for Engineering and audit trail for Compliance.

### 3. Transformed Stakeholder Dynamics with Compliance and Risk

Embedded regulatory teams in design sprints from day one, reframing them as co-creators rather than gatekeepers.

Baked regulatory requirements into the design process rather than bolting them on at the end, enabling faster progress than any previous digital initiative.


### 4. Designed and Launched Coutts Mobile App (iOS and Android)

Led the design of Coutts' first modern native mobile experience, replacing fragmented legacy portals with a cohesive app built on "Quiet Confidence"—clarity and discretion without gamification.

Achieved 4.2+ app rating and zero security incidents post-launch.

### 5. Elevated Design from "Styling" to Strategic Function
