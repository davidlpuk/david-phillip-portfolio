# Testimonial Request Templates for David Phillip

This document provides draft messages David can send to his references to request metric-specific testimonials for his portfolio. The goal is to transform generic praise ("David is great") into compelling, quantified impact statements ("David's redesign increased NPS from -16 to +12").

---

## Part 1: Why Metric-Specific Testimonials Matter

### The Problem with Qualitative-Only Testimonials

Testimonials that say "David is a great designer" or "David is very talented" don't differentiate you from thousands of other designers. Hiring managers at fintech companies see dozens of portfolios weekly. Generic praise gets skimmed over and forgotten.

### What Makes Testimonials Compelling

**Weak testimonial:**
> "David is an excellent designer and great to work with."

**Strong testimonial:**
> "David's redesign of our onboarding flow increased new user activation from 34% to 52%, contributing to a 28% reduction in support tickets."

The second version:
- Provides specific, verifiable numbers
- Shows business impact (support ticket reduction)
- Demonstrates cause-and-effect relationship
- Makes the hiring manager's job easier—they can quantify your potential contribution

### How to Ask Effectively

**Timing:** Send requests when the relationship is warm, ideally within 3-6 months of working together. Avoid cold outreach to old contacts.

**Channel:** LinkedIn InMail/Message or email work best. Keep it brief and mobile-friendly.

**Framing:** Be specific about what you're asking for. Give them a concrete prompt rather than an open-ended "write something nice about me."

**Reciprocity:** Offer to return the favour or provide something of value (your updated portfolio link, a reference for them, etc.).

## Part 2: Draft Requests for Each Reference

### Reference 1: Michelle Bradbury

**Likely relationship:** Leadership at Cognism, likely managed David or was a key stakeholder.

**Relevant achievements to highlight:**
- Built design team from 0 to 4 designers
- NPS improvement from -16 to +12
- 4x growth in design team's scope/effectiveness

---

**To: Michelle Bradbury**  
**Subject: Quick favour — testimonial for my portfolio**

Hi Michelle,

I hope you're doing well. I'm currently updating my portfolio as I explore new opportunities for Head of Design / VP Product Design roles in fintech.

I remember you mentioning during my time at Cognism how the team's evolution from a solo function to a team of four was instrumental in scaling the product. Would you be willing to share a few words about that? Specifically, I'd love if you could speak to:

- How the design function's growth impacted product quality or velocity
- Any metrics you recall around user satisfaction or NPS during that period
- What changed for the business once we had dedicated design leadership

Even 2-3 sentences would be incredibly helpful. Here's a prompt if it's easier:

> "When David joined, design was ad-hoc. Within 18 months, he built a team of X that delivered [specific outcome]..."

Would you be comfortable sharing something along these lines? I'm happy to jump on a quick call if that's easier.

Thank you so much — I really appreciate your support.

Best,  
David

- The impact on user satisfaction (NPS went from -16 to +12 during this period)

During my time at Cognism, you had a close view of how design functioned as a strategic capability rather than just a service. I'd love to ask a favour: would you be willing to share a few words about the business impact of that shift? I'm hoping you could speak to:

## Part 4: What to Do with New Testimonials

### How to Integrate into Portfolio

Once you receive new metric-specific testimonials, update the [Testimonials section](client/src/components/Testimonials.tsx) of your portfolio. The current implementation displays testimonials with author name, title, and company.

### Recommended Updates

1. **Replace weak testimonials first:** If any existing testimonials are purely qualitative ("David is great"), consider replacing them with new metric-specific ones.

2. **Prioritise business metrics:** Testimonials that mention NPS, user activation, support ticket reduction, or other business metrics should be featured prominently.

3. **Vary the angles:** Aim for testimonials that cover different aspects of your work:
   - Team building and leadership
   - Cross-functional partnership
   - Business impact and metrics
   - Design systems and scalability

### Example Portfolio Integration

When a testimonial arrives that says:

> "David built a design team from scratch at Cognism and drove NPS from -16 to +12 in 18 months. His leadership transformed how we think about product quality."

Update the testimonials component to include this alongside other strong quotes, positioning it where hiring managers will notice it early in their review.

### Tracking New Testimonials

Create a simple tracking system:

| Source | Received | Metric | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Michelle Bradbury | Yes/No | Team growth, NPS | Pending/Sent/Posted |
| Biljana Galapcheva | Yes/No | Cross-functional, velocity | Pending/Sent/Posted |
| Ljupcho Krstevski | Yes/No | Business impact, NPS | Pending/Sent/Posted |
| Kiri Romero | Yes/No | Design systems | Pending/Sent/Posted |
| Andre Martins | Yes/No | Project outcomes | Pending/Sent/Posted |
| Usha Sanku | Yes/No | Collaboration | Pending/Sent/Posted |

---

## Part 5: Quick Reference — Key Metrics to Request

Based on your portfolio achievements, here are the specific metrics to ask each reference about:

| Reference | Primary Metric | Secondary Metric | Conversation Prompt |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Michelle Bradbury | Team growth (0→4) | NPS improvement (-16→+12) | "How did design's evolution impact the business?" |
| Biljana Galapcheva | Design system adoption | Feature velocity | "What changed for engineering after the design system?" |
| Ljupcho Krstevski | NPS improvement | Business outcomes | "What was the ROI of investing in design leadership?" |
| Kiri Romero | Design system impact | Consistency metrics | "How did the systematic approach improve things?" |
| Andre Martins | Project outcomes | Team collaboration | "What did we achieve together?" |
| Usha Sanku | Collaboration quality | Project delivery | "What made our partnership effective?" |

---

## Final Tips

1. **Personalise each message** — Reference specific memories or projects.

2. **Make it easy for them** — Provide a prompt, but don't require them to use your exact words.

3. **Be patient but persistent** — Follow up once after a week if needed.

4. **Express genuine gratitude** — These people are doing you a favour.

5. **Return the favour** — Offer to write a testimonial for them or help in other ways.

6. **Update them when you succeed** — Let them know how their testimonial helped you land your next role.

## Part 6: C-Suite Testimonial Requests

Templates for requesting testimonials from executives (CMO, CPO, CTO, CEO) at Coutts, NatWest, and other financial institutions. These focus on strategic impact, business outcomes, and leadership at the highest level.

### Key Differences from Peer Testimonials

**Peer testimonials** focus on collaboration, day-to-day working relationships, and project outcomes.

**C-suite testimonials** should emphasize:
- Strategic thinking and business acumen
- Ability to influence at the executive level
- Measurable business outcomes (revenue, efficiency, risk reduction)
- Leadership that drives company objectives
- Cross-functional influence and stakeholder management

### Executive Testimonial Request Strategy

1. **Timing is critical:** Reach out when the relationship is warm, ideally within 6-12 months of working together.

2. **Channel:** LinkedIn InMail or direct email works best. Keep it brief — executives have limited time.

3. **Make it easy:** Provide a concrete prompt rather than asking them to "write something nice."

4. **Focus on business value:** Executives think in terms of business outcomes, so frame your ask around measurable impact.

5. **Leverage mutual connections:** If you have a shared contact, mention it to increase response rates.
