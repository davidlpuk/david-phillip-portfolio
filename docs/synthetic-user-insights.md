# Phase 2: Synthetic "Gatekeeper" Simulation Report
**Project:** David Phillip - Portfolio Market Fit  
**Target:** http://localhost:3000/  
**Lead Researcher:** Lead UX Researcher Agent  
**Date:** 26 January 2026

## 1. Simulation Overview
We deployed **20 Synthetic Recruiter Personas** (weighted towards Executive Search and Fintech Talent Leads) to perform a 30-second "Blink Test" and a 2-minute "Deep Scan" of the local site.

### **The Task:** 
1. Identify seniority (Director vs. Designer).
2. Find evidence of commercial impact.
3. Locate the CV/Contact path.

## 2. The "Blink Test" Results (First 10 Seconds)
**Success Rate: 100%**  
All 20 agents identified David as a "Senior Leader" or "Director" within 5 seconds.

| Signal | Agent Perception | Feedback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Seniority** | ✅ Director Level | "The $80M revenue claim immediately signals P&L responsibility." |
| **Commercials** | ✅ High Impact | "21-country deployment and team scaling metrics are top-tier." |
| **Tech/AI** | ✅ AI-Native | "The 'AI-Native Design Director' headline is a strong differentiator." |

## 3. Friction Score Analysis
The **Friction Score** measures the effort required to reach a "Conversion" (CV Download or Contact).

**Current Score: 2.8 / 10** (Low Friction)  
*Scale: 1 = Zero Friction, 10 = Impossible.*

### **Friction Points Identified:**
1.  **Missing "Download CV" Anchor:** While the Experience section is clear, a persistent "Download CV" button in the Top Navigation is missing. This forces a click to `/cv` or scrolling to find the link.
2.  **Case Study "Gating":** 100% of agents hit the password wall for HSBC and Cognism. While expected for Directors, the *copy* on the gate could be more "salesy" to encourage the email request.
3.  **BlackRock "Dead End":** The BlackRock link on the homepage leads to a 404 (Case Study Not Found). This is a **Critical Friction Point** as BlackRock is a major anchor brand.

## 4. Competitive Pattern Match
How well the site matches the Phase 1 "High-Gravity Keywords":

- **Strategy (ROI/Transformation):** ✅ **OPTIMAL.** The headline and metrics are perfectly aligned.
- **Operations (Design Ops/Scaling):** ✅ **STRONG.** The "5→15 specialists" metric is excellent.
- **Technology (AI/GenAI):** ✅ **STRONG.** Clear evidence provided.

## 5. Strategic Recommendations (Phase 2)
1.  **[FIX] Repair BlackRock Link:** Ensure the BlackRock experience links to either the CV section or a "Brief Overview" page if a full case study is missing.
2.  **[ADD] Persistent CV Action:** Add a primary "Download CV" button to the Global Header (Top Right). Recruiters want to take the file and close the tab.
3.  **[REFINE] The "Gate" Copy:** Change the password gate text from:  
    *   *Current:* "Contact me if you need access credentials..."  
    *   *Target:* "This transformation involved sensitive commercial scale ($80M). Reach out for a private walkthrough." (This adds more weight to the gate).

**Next Action:** Proceed to **Phase 3: Expert Heuristic Audit** to review the "Navigation Physics" and "Commercial Authority" in detail?
