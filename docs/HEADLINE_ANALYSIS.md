## 🎯 Selected Headline

**"Design leadership that ships"**

---

## Why This Works Best

### 1. **Action-Oriented** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**"Ships"** is a concrete, tangible verb:
- ✅ Not abstract (vs "orchestrate", "coordinate")
- ✅ Software industry lingua franca
- ✅ Implies completion, not just activity
- ✅ Measurable outcome

**Examples in context:**
- "We shipped 12 features this quarter" ✅ Clear
- "We orchestrated 12 features this quarter" ❌ Vague

### 2. **Differentiating** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Sets you apart from typical design leaders:

| What Most Say | What You Say | Difference |
|---------------|--------------|------------|
| "Design strategy" | "Design leadership that ships" | Execution focus |
| "User-centered design" | "Design leadership that ships" | Outcome focus |
| "Design excellence" | "Design leadership that ships" | Delivery focus |
| "Design thinking" | "Design leadership that ships" | Results focus |

**Your positioning:**
- Others: Process, theory, frameworks
- You: Actual shipped products

### 3. **Brand Alignment** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

|--------|-------------------------|
| AI-Native Orchestration | "Insight-to-**shipped** cycles" |
| Technical Fluency | "I **ship** code and design systems" |
| Strategic Execution | "**Shipping** quality software" |

The word "ships" appears in ALL THREE pillars' body text.

### 4. **Memorable** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Memorability test:**
