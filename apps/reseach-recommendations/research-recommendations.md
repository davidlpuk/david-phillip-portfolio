## 1. The Recruiter "Scan" Heatmap
Based on current senior mandates at UK Tier-1 agencies, there is a clear "Checklist" that determines if a candidate survives the initial 6-second filter.

### **Top Priority (The "Non-Negotiables"):**
*   **Commercial Weight:** Recruiters are scanning for Currency (£/$) and Growth metrics (%). They need to justify you to a CPO/CTO.
*   **Leadership Depth:** Specific evidence of "Scaling" and "Mentorship". Zebra People specifically mandates "Team Growth with Zero Attrition".
*   **Sector Authority:** For David, this is **Fintech/Enterprise Scale**. This is your "Halo Effect".

## 2. Competitive Keyword Hit-List
These terms have the highest "Search Gravity" for senior mandates in 2026.

| Category | High-Gravity Keywords | Status in Portfolio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategy** | ROI, Roadmap Alignment, Stakeholder Buy-in, Commercial Metrics | ✅ Strong |
| **Operations** | Design Ops, Scaling Pipelines, Mentorship Frameworks | ⚠️ Mentioned, but needs emphasis |
| **Technology** | AI-Native, GenAI Ops, Data-Informed Design | ✅ Strong (Unique Differentiator) |
| **Outcome** | Transformation, 0-1 Product, Global Deployment | ✅ Strong |

## 3. Recommended Copy Calibrations (The "Before & After")

To optimize for the recruiter "Pattern Match," we must move from **Brand-Centric** titles to **Outcome-Centric** titles.

### **Hero Refinement:**
*   **Current:** "AI-native design leader [...] shipping production code."
*   **Recommendation:** "AI-Native Design Director. Scaling teams & driving $80M+ revenue impact through strategic Fintech transformation."
*   **Rationale:** Recruiters scan for "Director" and "Revenue" before "Code".

### **Case Study Titles (Critical):**
| Current Title | Recommended Outcome-First Title |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HSBC Kinetic** | **HSBC Kinetic: Global Fintech Scale-up & $80M Growth** |
| **Cognism** | **Cognism: Scaling B2B SaaS Design Ops & Revenue Velocity** |
| **BlackRock** | **BlackRock: Enterprise Digital Transformation at Scale** |

## 4. Strategic Recommendations (Phase 1)

1.  **Introduce a "Leadership Pillar":** Zebra People consultants look for "Leadership Philosophy". Enhance your About section with a sub-heading: *"The Leadership Framework: Scaling with High-Performance & Zero Attrition".*
2.  **Frictionless CV Access:** Ensure the "Download CV" button is a primary action in the header of every case study page.
3.  **AI Evidence Case Study:** If possible, add a 1-paragraph "AI Micro-Case Study" showing exactly *how* you used AI to save time or improve research quality. This validates the "AI-Native" claim.

**Next Action:** Shall I proceed to **Phase 2: Synthetic "Gatekeeper" Simulation** to pressure-test these new headlines against simulated recruiter personas?
