**Head of Design | AI-Native Design Leader | Fintech & SaaS | London**
London, UK | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidphillip/) | [Portfolio: david-phillip-portfolio.vercel.app](https://david-phillip-portfolio.vercel.app) | david.phillip@gmail.com 

**Design leader** with specialism in financial services and SaaS, now operating as an **AI-native practitioner** who orchestrates design, research, and engineering into unified delivery systems.

I don't just use AI tools—I design workflows that compress discovery-to-delivery cycles, enabling small teams to ship faster without sacrificing quality or governance. My edge is **orchestration**: knowing what to build, why it matters, and how to get it shipped properly.

Track record of scaling teams (5→15), launching award-winning products (Coutts mobile app, HSBC Kinetic), and driving measurable business impact ($20M→$80M revenue growth at Cognism). Equally comfortable as a hands-on IC or leading multidisciplinary teams across UX, research, and design operations.
